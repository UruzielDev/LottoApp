# LottoApp

A Lotto App in C#. The code creates a Windows Forms application that has two list boxes and two buttons. The first list box is for storing the numbers that can be selected and the second list box is for storing the numbers that have been selected randomly. The first list box is populated with the numbers 1 to 50 when the form is loaded. When the "Generate" button is clicked, a random number is selected from the first list box and added to the second list box in red color. The number that was selected is then removed from the first list box. The "Reset" button is used to clear both list boxes and repopulate the first list box with the numbers 1 to 50.
